This package implements some of the tools described in 

Holzmann, H. and Klar, B. (2024). Robust performance metrics for imbalanced classification problems.

It calculates the robust Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and the robust F-Beta Score, which are performance metrics designed for imbalanced classification problems.
Along with the robust MCC, the ROC curve and the recall/1-precision curve are plotted.
