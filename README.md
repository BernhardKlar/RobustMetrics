This package implements some of the tools described in 

Holzmann, H., Klar, B. (2024). Robust performance metrics for imbalanced classification problems.

arXiv:2404.07661. \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07661}{LINK}

It calculates robust MCC and robust F-Beta Score, performance metrics designed for imbalanced classification problems.
A ROC curve and a recall / 1-precision curve are plotted along with the robust Matthew correlation coefficient.
